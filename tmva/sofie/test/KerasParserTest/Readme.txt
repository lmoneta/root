This folder is used to test the python parser from keras neural networks to RModel class.
This is done by comparing the results of the inference using keras and the generated c++ code.
For each model in the folder, the Tester file will create a c++ inference code and compare the results.

This was part of summer student internship done by Uri Stern, under the supervision of Lorenzo Moneta.
